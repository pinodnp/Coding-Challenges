# Coding-Challenges
Compilation of coding challenges done during coding practice and coding contests. 

Difficulties of the problems (as per Leetcode Difficulty levels) range from Easy to Hard.

As some LeetCode problems don't have a solution, I am including here all the problems I have attempted (in challenges and contests) for which my solution has been accepted. I am hoping anyone starting to study algorithms finds them useful.

Please feel free to recommend better solutions as I am just trying to learn.
